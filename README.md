# 5NotesToTxt
5NotesToTxt saves up to 5 notes containing a timestamp, a topic name, a note into 5 seprate .txt-files. The app is written in Java using OOP.  

I use this console application to use what I learned about OOP in Java. 

Next steps:
            - formatting the text files at a certain character amount per line
    
This code could be interesting for anyone who wants to get into object-oriented programming using Java.

There could be comments missing or methods without any use right now/ever. 

Files:
  - Main.java (writing pre-defined notes into .txt-files)
  - SuperNote.java
  - Note.java
  - NoteMgr.java (manages the user2app-interactions) 
  - FileMgr (manages creating/deleting/... files)
